A lightweight **Asset Manager for Autodesk Maya**, built with Python and PySide2.  
This tool helps you organize, browse, and manage shows and assets inside Maya projects with a simple UI.

### ⚠️ Disclaimer

This is our first open source project. We are mostly a riggers with a lot of Python experience, and this tool was created using "vibecoding" to solve organizational issues we were having while rapidly growing our personal and professional projects.  

We are still learning how open source works, and may not have set up the structure, code, or license perfectly.  
All feedback, suggestions, and contributions are very welcome! Please feel free to help improve the project in any way.

## ▶️ Usage

In Maya, open the Script Editor and run:
```python
import Blue_Pipeline
from importlib import reload
from Blue_Pipeline.UI.assets_manager import load_asset_manager
reload(load_asset_manager)
cAssetsManagerUI = load_asset_manager.AssetsManagerUI()

```

## 🛠️ Development Notes

- Built with **PyQt5** and **Python 3**.  
- The project is modular — UI setup, file operations, and state persistence are separated for clarity.  
- Error handling is included to ensure a smooth workflow even if no shows/assets exist.
